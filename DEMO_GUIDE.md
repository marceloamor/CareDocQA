## 🎭 **Live Demo Script (15-20 minutes)**

### **Opening (2 minutes)**
> *"I've built CareDocQA - a microservice-based healthcare AI system that demonstrates enterprise architecture patterns. Let me show you the complete system in action."*

**Open browser to:** `http://localhost:3000`

### **Architecture Overview (3 minutes)**
> *"This showcases a production-ready microservice architecture:"*

1. **React Frontend** (Port 3000) - Healthcare-focused UI
2. **API Gateway** (Port 8000) - Request orchestration & routing  
3. **Document Service** (Port 5000) - File storage & database
4. **AI Service** (Port 5100) - OpenAI integration with cost tracking

**Show:** `http://localhost:8000/docs` - API documentation

### **Feature Demonstration (8-10 minutes)**

#### **Demo 1: Upload & Query Mrs Wilson's Care Plan**
1. **Upload** `care_plan_mrs_wilson.txt`
2. **Ask:** *"What medications does Mrs Wilson take and when?"*
3. **Highlight:** 
   - Real-time AI response
   - Cost tracking (tokens/cost display)
   - Healthcare-specific context understanding

#### **Demo 2: Emergency Procedures**
1. **Upload** `emergency_procedures.txt`
2. **Ask:** *"What should I do if there's a fire emergency?"*
3. **Show:** 
   - Multi-service communication in action
   - System health monitoring
   - Professional healthcare UI

#### **Demo 3: Dementia Care Guidelines**
1. **Upload** `dementia_care_guidelines.txt`
2. **Ask:** *"How should I communicate with patients with dementia?"*
3. **Demonstrate:**
   - Document preview functionality
   - Chat interface with metadata
   - Cost accumulation

### **Technical Deep Dive (3-5 minutes)**

#### **Microservice Benefits:**
> *"Each service can be deployed, scaled, and maintained independently:"*

- **Service Independence:** Document storage vs AI processing
- **Technology Diversity:** FastAPI + Flask + React
- **Fault Tolerance:** API Gateway handles service failures
- **Clear Separation:** Database, AI, and UI concerns

#### **Full-Stack Integration:**
- **Frontend:** Modern React with hooks, state management
- **Backend:** RESTful APIs with proper error handling
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI GPT with cost optimization
- **Data Management:** SQLite with file storage

### **Production Readiness (2 minutes)**
> *"This demonstrates enterprise-level thinking:"*

- **Health Monitoring:** `/health` endpoints across all services
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation and user feedback
- **Cost Management:** Real-time AI usage tracking
- **Logging:** Centralized logs for debugging
- **Easy Deployment:** One-command startup

## 🗣️ **Key Talking Points**

### **For Founding Engineer Role:**
1. **System Design:** *"I chose microservices to enable independent scaling and team development"*
2. **Healthcare Focus:** *"Real-world problem - helping care workers extract information from documentation"*
3. **Production Mindset:** *"Built with monitoring, error handling, and cost tracking from day one"*
4. **Full-Stack Skills:** *"Comfortable across React frontend, Python backend, and AI integration"*

### **Technical Decisions:**
- **GPT-3.5-turbo:** Cost optimization over GPT-4
- **SQLite + Filesystem:** Simple but scalable foundation  
- **API Gateway Pattern:** Central orchestration point
- **React Hooks:** Modern, maintainable frontend patterns

### **Scalability Path:**
- **Containerization:** Docker + Kubernetes ready
- **Database:** SQLite → PostgreSQL migration path clear
- **Caching:** Redis integration planned
- **Authentication:** JWT framework ready

## 🛠️ **Management Commands**

### **Reset Demo Between Sessions:**
```bash
# Quick database reset
python clear_database.py

# Full restart (enhanced with port cleanup)
Ctrl+C  # Stop services - now properly closes all ports!
./start_careDocQA.sh  # Restart everything

# Emergency port cleanup (if needed)
./kill_ports.sh
```

### **Port Management:**
```bash
# The startup script now has ENHANCED CLEANUP:
# - Graceful shutdown with TERM signal
# - Force kill with KILL signal  
# - Process group termination
# - Direct port cleanup with lsof
# - Verification of port status

# If ports are still stuck (backup method):
./kill_ports.sh

# Manual port check:
lsof -ti :3000 :8000 :5100 :5000
```

### **Debug Issues:**
```bash
# View service logs
tail -f logs/document-service.log
tail -f logs/ai-service.log
tail -f logs/api-gateway.log
tail -f logs/react-frontend.log

# Test individual services
curl http://localhost:5000/health
curl http://localhost:5100/health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### **Quick System Test:**
```bash
python test_frontend.py
```
