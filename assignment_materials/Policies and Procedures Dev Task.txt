Policies and Procedures

Section 1: Medication Administration
Medication management is an important aspect of care provision, and all carers must adhere to proper procedures when administering medications.
* Carers should check the service user’s care plan to ensure they understand the medication schedule and dosage.
* Confirm with the service user before administering any medication, and ensure they take it as prescribed.
* If a service user refuses medication, do not force them. Instead, document the refusal and report it to your supervisor.
* In cases where the service user appears confused or unaware of their medication routine, notify the family and seek guidance.
* Regular medication reviews should be scheduled, and any changes to prescriptions must be updated in the care plan.

Section 2: First Aid and Emergency Response
Social care providers may encounter situations requiring basic first aid or emergency response.
* Minor injuries such as cuts and scrapes should be cleaned and dressed following first aid procedures.
* In case of more serious injuries, such as suspected fractures, or if the service user is unconscious, contact emergency services immediately.
* In the event of bleeding or a medication overdose, carers should contact the service user's GP immediately for further guidance.
* If the GP is unavailable and the situation appears life-threatening, call 999 for urgent medical support.

Section 3: Mobility & Moving
Falls are a common risk among service users and must be handled with immediate care and attention to prevent further injury.
* If a service user has fallen, first assess their physical state. Check for any signs of injury such as bruising, cuts, or difficulty moving.
* Ensure the service user is in a safe, comfortable position before attempting to assist them.
* If the service user can stand with support, help them to a chair or bed. If not, seek further assistance from another carer.
* If a service user falls, you must email your supervisor immediately with details of the incident, including the time, location, and condition of the service user.
* If this is a recurring issue (two or more falls in a week), cc the Risk Assessor on the email and arrange for a moving and handling risk assessment review to address potential hazards and ensure the service user’s environment is safe.

Section 4: Personal Care and Dignity
Maintaining the dignity and privacy of service users is essential in all personal care activities.
* Always ensure privacy by closing doors and drawing curtains when providing personal care.
* Ask for the service user’s consent before beginning any personal care tasks and explain what you are going to do.
* Use proper personal protective equipment (PPE) to maintain hygiene and reduce infection risks.
* Respect the service user’s preferences for bathing, dressing, and other personal care routines, ensuring they feel comfortable at all times.
* If the service user expresses discomfort or refuses personal care, document the incident and email your supervisor. If this happens more than once, also cc the service user’s family for further support.
* If PPE is unavailable during personal care, email your supervisor and document the issue immediately.

Section 5: Mental Health and Emotional Well-being
Mental health is a critical component of overall well-being and should be monitored closely.
* Carers should be aware of changes in a service user’s behaviour, including signs of depression, anxiety, or withdrawal from social interactions.
* Regularly check in with service users to ensure their emotional needs are being met.
* If a service user expresses feelings of hopelessness, isolation, or distress, report this immediately to the supervisor.
* In cases where a service user calls in confused, disoriented, or excessively worried, alert their family or next of kin to inform them of the situation and ensure appropriate follow-up care can be arranged.
* Support plans should include mental health considerations, and services users should have access to mental health support if needed.

Section 6: Infection Control
Infection prevention is a key responsibility for all social care workers, especially when working with vulnerable populations.
* Always wash your hands before and after providing care to a service user.
* Use PPE such as gloves, aprons, and masks, as appropriate for the task at hand.
* Disinfect equipment and surfaces regularly, especially in shared living spaces.
* If a service user is diagnosed with an infectious illness (e.g., flu, COVID-19), isolate them according to guidance and report the case to your supervisor.
* Follow proper waste disposal protocols for clinical waste, including dressings, gloves, and other materials.

Section 7: Nutrition and Hydration
Ensuring that service users are well-nourished and hydrated is vital for their overall health and well-being.
* Carers should prepare and serve meals that meet the dietary needs and preferences of service users, taking into account any allergies or medical conditions.
* Offer fluids regularly to prevent dehydration, especially in warmer weather or if the service user has difficulty communicating.
* Document any significant changes in eating habits, such as a refusal to eat or a sudden change in appetite, and report this to your supervisor.
* For service users on a specialised diet (e.g., diabetic, low-sodium), ensure that all meals adhere to the dietary guidelines provided.
